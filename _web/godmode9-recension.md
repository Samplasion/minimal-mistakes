## Description and Usage
GodMode9 ("GM9") isn't *just* a file manager.
It's a complete modding tool for the 3DS.<!--more-->
You open GM9 by pressing START at the boot. You'll be now greeted by a unit selection screen [SD, SYSnand, EMUnands, Gamecart].
By pressing [^]HOME you open additional options.
* For example, to extract the inserted gamecard to a cia:
1. go in [C] Gamecard
