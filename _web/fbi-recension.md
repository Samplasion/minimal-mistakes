### Description and Usage
FBI is a `.cia` installer.
#### Features
The following is [available at project home](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-fbi-open-source-cia-installer.386433/). {: .notice--info}
+ Available as a CIA, 3DS, and 3DSX. To use the 3DSX version, either ensure the required services are accessible, such as through Luma3DS's access patching option, or run a kernel exploit beforehand, such as fasthax or waithax.

### My Considerations

#### Pros
+ Open-Source
+ You can install `.cia`s with a qr code
+ You can install `.cia`s from <http://titledb.com>
+ The theme is customizable

#### Cons
+ If you use a Mac, FBI will try to install the `.[title].cia` file automatically created by the Mac, reporting an error
