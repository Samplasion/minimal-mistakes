You may have noticed some changes from the start of the website. Or maybe not because this is the first time you enter... _(I feel alone...)_.
Anyways, I'm starting customizing the site as much as I can. An example? The theme is now {{ site.minimal_mistakes_skin }}, and it's always update by magic.
Another example? _I don't know..._ Ah! The words per minute used to predict the reading time are now {{ site.words_per_minute }}, this post's excerpt (preview) is {{ page.excerpt }}, the comment provider is `{{ site.comments.provider }}` and {% if can_ponies_fly %}ponies can fly{% else %}ponies can't fly{% endif %}. (Okay, not sure about this last one but...)
I'm feeling joking.
