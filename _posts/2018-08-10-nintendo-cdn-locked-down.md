Nintendo has locked down their CDN. This means that we will not be able to access their eShop servers anymore.
<!--more-->

With Nintendo blocking our way to their titles, returning a ```403 Forbidden``` error, we have to return to the old method of downloading games from souces other than the eShop.
This would also be the end of the ride for programs such as Wii U USB Helper and freeShop. Those, in fact, used to directly **access** Nintendo's server to get a list of titles and download them. But with Nintendo putting under lock and key their games, those programs are rendered useless.

{% include gallery caption="We will remember the help those two programs have given." %}

That said, let's hope Nintendo doesn't do anything crazy to block hacking.
