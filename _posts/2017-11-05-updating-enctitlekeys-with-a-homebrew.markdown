freeShop is a homebrew that makes easy to download games that you already own from Nintendo's servers, in an open-source way.

However, that said titles are stored in a file called **encTitleKeys**. This file is illegal tho share and contains all user purchased titles. And here comes to play an homebrew called **freeShop launcher**. At start, that homebrew downloads the latest title keys from [here](http://3ds.titlekeys.gq) and then starts freeShop, allowing a download of all available _-and not-_ titles on the eShop, even titles of the “Nintendo Ambassadors Program”.

freeShop makes it easy to download DLCs, too, in a GUI available in many languages.
You can download freeShop [here](https://freeshop.pw). See my recension [here](/web/freeshop-recension/)
