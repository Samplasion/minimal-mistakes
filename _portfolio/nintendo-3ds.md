One of my main consoles.

![3ds-1](/assets/images/3ds-1.jpg){: .align-left} A black New Nintendo 3DS with a red Mario cover on it. ABXY keys are colored like SNES.

![3ds-3](/assets/images/3ds-3.jpg){: .align-right} The upper screen presents some scratches due to lower screen shape.

There are b9s and Luma3DS installed.
The installed titles are many, some of which were downloaded with [freeShop](/web/freeshop-recension/). Some of them are custom Virtual Consoles.
