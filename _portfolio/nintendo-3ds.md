One of my main consoles.

![3ds-1](/assets/images/3ds-1.jpg) A black New Nintendo 3DS with a red Mario cover on it. ABXY keys are colored like SNES.

![3ds-3](/assets/images/3ds-3.jpg) The upper screen presents some scratches due to lower screen shape.

There are b9s and Luma3DS installed.
NTR CFW is installed, too.
The installed titles are many, some of which were downloaded with [freeShop](/web/freeshop-recension/). Some of them are custom Virtual Consoles.

I like keeping the two screws on the back side open: the cover won’t fall. Inside it there’s an almost full 16GB SD card. The free space is ~1GB.
